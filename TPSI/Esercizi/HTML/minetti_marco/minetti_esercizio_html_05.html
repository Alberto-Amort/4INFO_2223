    <h1>Localhost</h1>
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" target="_blank"><mark>computer networking</mark></a>, localhost is a
    <small>hostname</small> that refers to the current computer used to access it. It is <b>used</b> to access the network services that are
    running on the host via the loopback <i>network</i> interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network
    interface hardware.

    <h3>Loopback</h3>
    <span style="color:green">The local loopback</span> mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without
    requiring a physical network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may
    be connected to. For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL
    http://localhost to display its home page.
    The name localhost normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the IPv6 loopback address ::1.

    
    
    <h3>Name resolution</h3>
    <img src="https://media.fs.com/images/community/upload/wangEditor/201912/24/_1577182449_2uLs0pQcuT.jpg" alt="xxx">

    <br/>
    <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPv4 network standards</a> reserve the entire address
    block 127.0.0.0/8 (more than 16 million addresses) for <strong>loopback purposes</strong>.[2] That means any packet sent to any of
    those addresses is looped back. The address <i>127.0.0.1</i> is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest
    are not supported by all operating systems. However, they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the
    host, all listening on the same port number. The IPv6 standard assigns only a single address for loopback: ::1.
    The resolution of the name localhost to one or more IP addresses is normally configured by the following lines in
    the operating system's hosts file:
    <div class="myDiv"><small><em>127.0.0.1</em> localhost </small></div>

    <div class="myDiv"><em><small>::1</em> localhost </small></div>

    The name may also be resolved by <span style="color:green"><strong> Domain Name System </strong> (DNS) servers</span>, but queries for
    this name should be resolved locally, and should not be forwarded to remote name servers.

    In addition to the mapping of localhost to the <b>loopback addresses</b> (127.0.0.1 and ::1), localhost may also be mapped
    to other <b>IPv4</b> (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to any loopback
    address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated loopback address range in the hosts file or
    in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.
    
    <ins>In the Domain Name System</ins>, the name localhost is reserved as a top-level domain name,<ins> originally set aside to avoid
    confusion with the hostname used for loopback purposes.</ins>[3] IETF standards prohibit domain name registrars from
    assigning the name localhost.

    <h3>IETF standards</h3>
    The name <strong>localhost</strong> is reserved for <i>loopback purposes</i> by RFC 6761 (Special-Use Domain Names),[4] which achieved the
    Proposed Standard maturity level in February 2013. The standard sets forth a number of special considerations
    governing the use of the name in the Domain Name System:

    An <span style="color:red">IPv4</span> or <span style="color:red">IPv6</span> address query for the name localhost
    must always resolve to the respective loopback address, which is specified in a separate standard.
    Applications may resolve the name to a loopback address themselves, or pass it to the local name resolver
    mechanisms.

        <img src="https://kinsta.com/it/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/cos-e-localhost-1.png" alt="immage">
    </a>
    When a <mark>name resolver</mark> receives an address <i>(A or AAAA)</i> query for localhost, it should return the appropriate loopback
    addresses, and negative responses for any other requested record types. Queries for localhost should not be sent to
    caching name servers.
    To avoid <b>burdening</b> the <mark>Domain Name System</mark> root servers with traffic, caching name servers should never request name
    server records for localhost, or forward resolution to authoritative name servers.
    <small>DNS registrars</small> are precluded from delegating domain names in the top-level domain localhost.
    When <em>authoritative</em> name servers receive queries for 'localhost' in spite of the provisions mentioned resolve them
    appropriately.
    The IPv4 <strong>loopback addresses</strong> are reserved within the IPv4 address space by the IETF "Special Use IPv4 Addresses"
    standard <small>(RFC 5735)</small>.[5] The reservation can be traced back to the November 1986 "Assigned Numbers" standard <small>(RFC
    990).</small>

    In contrast, the <strong>IETF</strong> "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" standard (RFC 4291) reserves the single IPv6 loopback
    address ::1 within the IPv6 address space. The <em>standard</em> precludes the assignment of that address to any physical
    interface, as well as its use as the source or destination address in any packet sent to remote hosts.  Any such
    packet that is erroneously transmitted is not supposed to be routed,<del> and should be dropped by all routers or hosts
    that receive it.</del> 

    <h3>Packet processing</h3>
    The <span style="color:red">processing</span> of any <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/it-it/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/" target="_blank">packet</a> sent
    to a loopback address, is implemented in the link layer of the TCP/IP stack. Such <mark>packets</mark> are never passed to any
    network interface controller (NIC) or hardware device driver and must not appear outside of a computing system, or
    be routed by any router. This permits software testing and local services in the absence of any hardware network
    interfaces.

    Looped-back <i>packets</i> are distinguished from any other packets traversing the TCP/IP stack only by the special IP
    address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that ultimately receive them respond according to the specified
    destination. For example, an <b>HTTP</b> service could route packets addressed to 127.0.0.99:80 and 127.0.0.100:80 to
    different Web servers, or to a single server that returns different web pages. To simplify such testing, the hosts
    file may be configured to provide appropriate names for each address.

    <mark>Packets</mark> received on a <i>non-loopback</i> interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped. Such
    packets are sometimes referred to as Martian packets.[6] As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious and
    any problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

    <h3>Special cases</h3>
    The releases of the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/it/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database differentiate between the
    use of the <em>hostname</em> localhost and the use of the addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.[7] When using localhost as the
    destination in a client connector interface of an application, the <sub>MySQL</sub> application programming interface connects
    to the database using a Unix domain socket, while a <sup>TCP</sup> connection via the loopback interface requires the direct
    use of the explicit address.

    notable exception to the use of the <em>127.0.0.0/8</em> addresses is their use in <strong>Multiprotocol Label Switching</strong> <em>(MPLS)</em>
    traceroute error detection, in which their property of not being routable provides a convenient means to avoid
    delivery of faulty packets to end users. <br>
