        In computer networking, <b>localhost</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname"
            target="_blank">hostname</a> that refers to the current computer used to access it. It is
        used to access the network services that are running on the host via the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback" target="_blank">loopback</a> network interface. Using the
        loopback interface bypasses any local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller"
            target="_blank">network interface hardware</a>.

    <h2>
        Loopback
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <u>local</u><b> loopback mechanism</b> may be used to run a network service on a host without requiring a physical network
        interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be connected to. <i>For
        example</i>, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL http://localhost to display
        its home page.
        The name localhost <u>normally</u> resolves to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"
            target="_blank">IPV4</a> loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the <mark>IP<sub>v</sub>6 loopback address</mark>
        ::1.

    </p>
    <h2>
        Name resolution
    </h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> network standards reserve the entire
        address block <em>127.0.0.0/8</em> <mark>(more than 16 million addresses)</mark> for
        loopback purposes.[2] That means any packet sent to any of those addresses is looped back. <span
            class="text">The address 127.0.0.1</span>
        is the standard address for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> loopback
        traffic; the rest are not supported by all operating systems. However,
        they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the host, all listening on the same port number. The
        IPv6 standard assigns only a single address for <mark>loopback: ::1</mark>.
        The resolution of the name localhost to one or more <u>IP addresses</u> is normally configured by the following lines
        in the <u>operating</u> system's hosts file:
        <b>127.0.0.1 localhost
        ::1 localhost</b>

        The name may also be resolved by <span class="text">Domain Name System <abbr>(DNS)</abbr> servers</span>, but queries for
        this name should be resolved
        locally, and should not be forwarded to remote name servers.

        <img src="what-is-a-dns-server.png" alt="dns server" width="900" height="500" />
        <br />
        In addition to the mapping of localhost to the loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 and ::1), localhost may also be
        mapped to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> (loopback) addresses and
        it is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to any
        loopback address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated loopback address range in the
        hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.
    <div class="important">
        In the <em>Domain Name System</em>, the name localhost is reserved as a top-level domain name, originally set aside to
        avoid confusion with the hostname used for loopback purposes.[3] <span class="text"><abbr>IETF</abbr></span> standards
        prohibit domain name registrars
        from assigning the name <u>localhost</u>.
    </div>


    </p>
    <h2>
        IETF standards
    </h2>
    <p>
        The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes by <span class="text">RFC 6761 (Special-Use Domain
            Names)</span>,[4] which achieved
        the <i>Proposed Standard maturity level</i> in  February 2013 . The standard sets forth a number of special
        considerations governing the use of the name in the <mark>Domain Name System</mark>:

        An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> or IPv6 address query for the name
        localhost must always resolve to the respective loopback address,
        which is specified in a separate standard.
        Applications may resolve the name to a loopback address themselves, or pass it to the local name resolver
        mechanisms.
        When a <b>name resolver receives an address <i>(A or AAAA)</i></b> query for localhost, it should return the appropriate
        <s>loopback</s> addresses, and negative responses for any other requested record types. Queries for localhost should
        not be sent to caching name servers.
        To avoid burdening the Domain Name System root servers with traffic, caching name servers should never request
        name server records for localhost, or forward resolution to authoritative name servers.
        <s>DNS</s> registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in the top-level domain localhost.
        When authoritative name servers receive queries for <i>'localhost' </i>in spite of the provisions mentioned resolve
        them appropriately.
    <div class="important">
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> loopback addresses are reserved within
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> address space by the IETF "Special Use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" target="_blank">IPV4</a> Addresses"
        standard (RFC 5735).[5] The reservation can be traced back to the November 1986 "Assigned Numbers" standard (RFC
        990).
    </div>
    In contrast, the <abbr>IETF</abbr> <b>"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"</b> standard <mark>(RFC 4291)</mark> reserves the single IPv6
    loopback address ::1 within the <u>IPv6</u> address space. The standard precludes the assignment of that address to any
    physical interface, as well as its use as the source or destination address in any packet sent to remote hosts.
    Any such packet that is erroneously <del>transmitted</del>   is not <del>supposed</del> to be routed, and <del>should</del> be dropped by all
    routers or hosts that <u>receive</u> it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Packet processing
    </h2>
    <p>
        The processing of any packet sent to a loopback address, is implemented in the link layer of the <span
            class="text">TCP/IP</span> stack.
        Such packets are never passed to any <span class="text">network interface controller (NIC)</span> or hardware
        device driver and must not
        appear outside of a computing system, or be routed by any router. This permits software testing and local
        services in the absence of any hardware network <small>interfaces</small>.

        Looped-back packets are <small>distinguished</small> from any other packets traversing the TCP/IP stack only by the special IP
        address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that ultimately receive them respond according to the
        specified destination. For example, an <u>HTTP</u> service could route packets addressed to 127.0.0.99:80 and
        <u>127.0.0.100:80</u> to different <small>Web servers</small>, or to a single server that returns different web pages. To simplify
        such testing, the hosts file may be configured to provide appropriate names for each address.

        Packets received on a <small>non-loopback</small> interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped. Such
        packets are sometimes referred to as Martian packets.[6] As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious
        and any problems they might <small>cause </small>can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

    <h2>
        Special cases
    </h2>
    <p>
        The releases of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database
        differentiate between the use of the hostname localhost and the use of the
        addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1. [7]  When using localhost as the destination in a client connector interface of an
        application, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank">MySQL</a> application programming
        interface connects to the database using a  Unix  domain socket,
        while a TCP connection via the loopback interface requires the direct use of the explicit address.
        <br />
        
        <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank">
            <img src="https://www.geekandjob.com/uploads/wiki/eceb15684d4183c66f73c1a9bb777eef708b2b66.png" width="700"
                height="500" />
        </a>
        <br />
        One notable exception to the use of the 127.0.0.0/8 addresses is their use in <span class="text">Multiprotocol
            Label Switching
            (MPLS)</span> traceroute error  detection , in which their property of not being routable provides a
        convenient means to
        avoid delivery of faulty packets to end users.
